# Our Innovation

**The Issue:** 
Low-income private school teachers in remote regions lack the motivation and incentives to grow professionally and financially. The requirement of the platform is to create a closed-loop feedback system and gamify training modules to provide greater incentives and promote enhanced student outcomes.

**Our solution:**
1. End-to-end closed-loop system of observation, feedback, and implementation, with gamified modules for training.
2. Low bandwidth requirement by local caching, offline accessibility, and cloud deployment.
3. Credit points, milestone badges, community forums, and social reach platforms to incentivize the teacher's professional and personal growth.
